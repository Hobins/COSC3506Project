# Construction Management System

## Description
This system allows users to login via the hardcoded values we have set to see the different screens and runs purely in memory.
which means that once the server is stopped, all data is reset. 

## Installation
To run this project, you will need have the following installed:
- JDK 21.0.2 or higher
- Maven 4.0.0
- an IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc.) Personally we used IntelliJ for this project.

## Usage
To run the project, 
- Step 1: Clone or download the code
- Step 2: Open the code with your java IDE (we used intellj)
- Step 3: Click on the `MainScreen` class and run the `main` method
- Step 4: A login screen should appear and you can login with the following credentials:


- Username: `admin`
- Password: `123`
  To see the admin panel and functions.

or
- Username: `user`
- Password: `123`
  To see the user panel and functions.

or
- Username: `contractor`
- Password: `123`
  To see the contractor panel and functions.


- Step 5: Once logged in, you can navigate through the system using the buttons on the screen.
- Step 6: To exit the system, click on the close the program if you use to test different users, you must re-run the program.


#NOTE 
- The system is hardcoded to only allow these 3 users to login.
- The system must be re-run to test the different users.
